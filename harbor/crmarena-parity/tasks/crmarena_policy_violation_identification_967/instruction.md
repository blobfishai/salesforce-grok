# CRM question

Did the agent breach the policy in this situation? If yes, which knowledge article was breached? Return only the Id of the knowledge article or None if no violation is found.

## Context


## How to work
The CRM is on the `crm` MCP server. Query it with `issue_soql_query` (SOQL;
relationship traversal like `Account.Name` and subqueries are not supported), and
use `get_schema` to see what fields an object has. `search_knowledge_articles`
searches the knowledge base.

When you have the answer, call `respond` **exactly once** with the answer only —
an Id, a value, or the string `None` if the question cannot be answered from the
data. Do not include explanation in the answer.
